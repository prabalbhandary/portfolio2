          Hello! I'm Prabal Bhandary, a passionate web development enthusiast
          currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. I love
          transforming ideas into beautiful, functional websites and
          applications. From an early age, I was fascinated by technology and
          how it shapes our lives. This curiosity led me to explore various
          programming languages and frameworks, enabling me to create innovative
          solutions. I thrive on challenges and constantly seek opportunities to
          learn and grow. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the
          latest tech trends, working on personal projects, or enjoying a good
          book. I'm excited about the future and look forward to collaborating
          with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology.
          Let's connect and create something amazing together!
